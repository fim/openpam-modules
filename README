This project was written in during April - August in 2008 
as part of the Google Summer of Code under the Gentoo Organization.

The aim of this project is to provide working PAM modules
for Linux which will be built against OpenPAM and will be able 
to work in a system without Linux-PAM. This will, hopefully, give
people the ability to choose which PAM library to use, which has
been one of the long term goals of the PAM team.

In order to build the modules, you must already have a system
with OpenPAM installed. The installation procedure for now is 
quite simple :  

>$ make && make install

should take care of everything. Also, after installing these PAM 
modules you should edit the files under /etc/pam.d/ to remove all 
unwanted entries. Sample files exist in examples/pam.d/ for the most 
common applications.
 
After replacing Linux-PAM with OpenPAM, all applications that
use PAM must be rebuild because while API compliant, Linux-PAM
and OpenPAM are not ABI compiant which can result in an unusable
system. One of these applications is the shadow package, which provides
passwd, the interface which enables users to update their passwords.
